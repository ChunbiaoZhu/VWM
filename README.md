## Abstract

Monitoring animals in the wild without disturbing them
is possible using camera trapping framework, which is a
technique to study wildlife using automatically triggered
cameras and produces great volumes of data. However,
camera trapping collects images often result in low image
quality and includes a lot of false positives (images
without animals), which must be detection before the postprocessing
step. This paper presents a two-channeled perceiving
residual pyramid networks (TPRPN) for cameratrap
images objection. Our TPRPN model attends to generating
high-resolution and high-quality results. In order
to provide enough local information, we extract depth cue
from the original images and use two-channeled perceiving
model as input to training our networks. Finally, the
proposed three-layer residual blocks learn to merge all the
information and generate full size detection results. Besides,
we construct a new high-quality dataset with the help
of Wildlife Thailandâ€™s Community and eMammal Organization.
Experimental results on our dataset demonstrate that
our method is superior to the existing object detection methods
